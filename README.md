# Probabilistic Graphical Models

You can find in this repository my solution to the labs of the *Introduction to Probabilistic Graphical Models* course at *Telecom ParisTech* by Pr. *Umut Simsekli* in the context of the *Msc Data Science*, a Master delivered by *Ecole Polytechnique*. 

- **Lab1**: Simulation of a moving robot across a circular corridor, whose positions are probabilistic. Knowing the probability model and a set of observations, we can find the most likely position at any time using *Hidden Markov Models*.

- **Lab 2**: Implementation of the EM (*Expectation-Maximization*) algorithm for GMMs (*Gaussian Mixture Models*) with mathematical proof.

- **Mini-project**: MAP (*Maximum a posteriori*) estimation on the probabilistic *non-negative matrix factorization* (NMF) using the *EM* algorithm. It is tested on a set of 400 images in order to create a base of face vectors.
